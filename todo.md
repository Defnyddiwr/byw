# ToDo

### Front end

#### Logic

+ Implement search from the home page, probably by using route url escaped route params for the map route
+ Implement rating system so that the category can update as more users chime in


#### Styling / content

+ Draw SVGs for each icon
+ Change the about page into a 'for business owners page'
+ Footer content

### Back end

+ Implement checking when submitting a new location to the index, and if the location is already in the index
just add to it
