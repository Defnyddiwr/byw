// This file is created by the build system and should not be manually edited or changes
// will be lost.

// It contains all the user facing text content translated into all the supported languages.
// Therefore App components only need to be passed a language and this text data object 
// via props to be able to render themselves in the user selected language. Components should only use
// supported keys (which are automatically generated for code completion) and therefore do not
// need to have knowledge of any part of the text content and any typos or missing keys will
// be found at build time.
